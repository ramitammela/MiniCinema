# MiniCinema3D
**Year:** Summer 2023 - work in progress (est. Fall 2023)  
**Made with:** Unity & C# language  

Video player plays video on the big screen in game. Posters that loads images (locally & URL), Customizable Lights. Settings Saving into .txt files.
In this project I used my learned skills from my previous projects (URLpicSaver and PhotoWidget) this time I wanted to try loading Video Files using Unity's Video Player.   
  
**Currently:**  
**Polishing phase:** Project is about done and fully functional. Still needs a little work in polishing/cleaning the scripts and graphics needs some more work.
